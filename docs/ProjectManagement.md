### Retrospective of Iteration 2:
In this release, we implemented a search feature and the possibility of seeing every teacher at UP, except the ones at FAUP, FBAUP, FFUP and FMDUP. The app now warns the user if the input is invalid and allows them to choose a faculty to see its teachers. We also implemented acceptance tests and unit tests. 

### Retrospective of Iteration 3:

#### Did well:

 - Changed rating process and parameters.
 - Implemented user login/register.

#### Do differently:

 - Divide user stories into smaller ones.

#### Puzzles:

 - Using the app, tapping the system's back button leads the user to the login page.
